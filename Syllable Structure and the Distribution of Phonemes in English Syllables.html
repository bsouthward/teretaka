<p class="abstract">In describing the phonotactics (patterning of
phonemes) of English syllables, linguists have focused on absolute
restrictions concerning which phonemes may occupy which slots of the
syllable. To determine whether probabilistic patterns also exist, we
analyzed the distributions of phonemes in a reasonably comprehensive
list of uninflected English CVC (consonant–vowel–consonant) words,
some 2,001 words in all. The results showed that there is a
significant connection between the vowel and the following consonant
(coda), with certain vowel-coda combinations being more frequent than
expected by chance.  In contrast, we did not find significant
associations between the initial consonant (onset) and the
vowel. These findings support the idea that English CVC syllables are
composed of an onset and a vowel–coda rime. Implications for lexical
processing are discussed.</p>

<p>Linguists have often observed absolute restrictions in the
patterning of phonemes in syllables.  For example, it is often noted
that /h/ can occur only at the start of an English syllable and that
/N/ can occur only at the end.  (See Tables 1 and 2 for an explanation
of the phonetic symbols.)  By the same token, certain combinations of
phonemes occur in the language, whereas others do not.  In the General
American English accent, /A/ can occur before /r/ at the end of a
syllable (<em>car</em>), but /æ/ cannot, and this rule has no
exceptions. In some languages, there are many more such gaps or
restrictions at the end of the syllable than at the beginning, and
such asymmetry has been accepted as evidence that the syllable has a
particular kind of internal structure (Goldsmith, 1990, p. 123-127).
In English, however, it is not so obvious that the end of the syllable
has many more restrictions than the beginning.  As a result, there has
been some debate as to whether there is enough imbalance in
phonotactic constraints to suggest internal syllable structure.
</p>

<p>This impasse can be broken, in our view, by abandoning the idea
that only absolute, inviolable restrictions are worthy of note.  We
take a probabilistic approach in the present study by asking whether
some consonants occur in certain positions of the syllable more or
less often than expected by chance, and whether some legal
combinations occur more or less often than expected by chance.  For
example, among the words we consider, we find that the sequence /Vf/ occurs
much more often than one would expect from the frequency of /V/ and /f/
considered independently, and /æl/ occurs much less often than
expected.  Even though there are several words that end in /æl/,
their unusually low frequency suggests a phonotactic restriction of a
nonabsolute, violable kind.  Broadening our purview to include
restrictions of this kind gives a clearer picture of the phonotactic
patterns of English. In the present study, we use statistical
techniques to examine the patterns of phoneme co-occurrences in the
CVC words of English --- single morphemes that consist of a vowel
flanked by exactly one consonant on each side.
</p>

<h2>Relevance of Syllable Phonotactics</h2>

<p>A statistical study of syllabic phonotactics is motivated by several
considerations.  On one level, we are interested in exploring the
validity of quantitative approaches to language in general.  Some
important schools of linguistics hold that language is best described
in terms of symbols and categories, and that quantitative tendencies
that cannot be reduced to a system of categorical rules are merely
accidents that are irrelevant to language as a systematic entity.
Davis (1985), for example, rejected all arguments for internal
syllable structure, on the grounds that he was able to find
exceptions, however rare, to all properties that had been proposed
for specific subsyllabic entities.  But many other language
researchers find quantitative approaches, such as connectionist
models, to be very useful.  One of our motivations is to show that a
quantitative approach to English phonotactics can uncover the same
types of patterns that have been noted as absolute rules in other
languages.  Researchers interested in universal properties of language
might take this as evidence that statistical patterns are not
necessarily accidental and deserve a closer look.
</p>

<p>A second motivation for our study is to contribute toward research in
lexical processing.  Recognition and production of a word can be
affected by how many other words are similar to it in pronunciation or
spelling (e.g., Goldinger, Luce, &amp; Pisoni, 1989; Grainger, 1992).
The magnitude of such effects is associated with which end of the word
one is considering.  For example, the beginning of a word is the most
salient part for identification (Cutler, 1982, p. 19).  Also, word
production is slower and more erratic when there are other words with
a similar beginning; interference is not so pronounced when there are
other words that have a similar ending (Sevald &amp; Dell, 1994).  If we
were to find that phonotactic patterns in English show a tendency to
constrain combinations of elements at the end of the syllable, thus
contributing toward making words more similar at their ends than at
their beginnings, then researchers will want to take such facts into
account when exploring the relation between processing asymmetries and
the structure of the English vocabulary.
</p>

<p>Our final reason for studying syllable phonotactics is the evidence it
may bring to bear on syllable structure.  Linguists have adduced every
possible configuration for the internal structure of syllables.  For
CVC syllables, the main concern is whether the vowel is grouped with
the prior consonant (called the onset), with the posterior consonant
(the coda), or with neither.  Figure 1 illustrates
those three basic theories.  The leftmost tree illustrates the theory
of the flat syllable, where the vowel groups with neither the onset
nor the coda (Clements &amp; Keyser, 1983; Davis, 1985; Hockett, 1955).
The second tree illustrates the onset-rime theory, where the vowel
groups with the coda to form a constituent called the rime (Fudge,
1969; Goldsmith, 1990; Kuryl~owicz, 1973; Selkirk,
1982).  The last tree illustrates the theory of body-coda
organization, where the vowel is grouped with the onset to form a
constituent called the body (McCarthy, 1979, p. 455; Iverson &amp;
Wheeler, 1989).  More recently, some phonologists have claimed that
the components of the syllable are units of weight called moras
(Hayes, 1989; Hyman, 1985).  As the trees in
Figure 2 illustrate, basic moric theory always has the
vowel in the first mora and the coda in the second, with the
complication that a long vowel is considered to be simultaneously in
both moras.

<p class="caption">

syllable structure, illustrated with <em>cap</em> (short vowel) and
<em>keep</em> (long vowel).
</p>

<p>Of all these theories, the onset-rime is perhaps the most widely
accepted, in our opinion rightly so.  Many linguistic phenomena are
easily described in terms of properties of the vowel and the coda
(i.e., the rime), with the onset consonant being irrelevant.  These
phenomena include verse metrics, word stress, and compensatory
lengthening (see Halle &amp; Vergnaud, 1982; Kuryl~owicz, 1973; and
Hayes, 1989 for descriptions).  It is much harder to find important
processes that depend on the body to the exclusion of the coda.
Rhyming traditions, language games such as Pig Latin, and speech
errors often treat rimes as units but rarely treat bodies as units
(e.g., MacKay, 1973; Stemberger, 1983).  Furthermore, the bulk of
experimental evidence favors the onset-rime theory (see Treiman &amp;
Kessler, 1995).  On the other hand, Davis (1985) argued for the flat
syllable; experiments with speakers of Korean suggest a body-coda
organization (Derwing, Yoon, &amp; Cho, 1993; Yoon, 1995); and
Pierrehumbert and Nair (1995) claimed that moric theory can account
for much of the experimental evidence.  The question of internal
syllable structure is not yet settled.
</p>

<p>We believe that a statistical study of syllable phonotactics can bring
light to the issue of syllable structure.  Although the theoretical
concept of linguistic <em>structure</em> is hard to pin down, many would
agree that a structure is the natural domain for a constraint or
process.  If, for example, different types of consonants may appear
before the vowel than after it, then that suggests that those are not
undifferentiated consonant slots, but rather that those two elements
belong to different structures.  We explore this issue in Study 1.  Of
course, most theories put the onset and coda in different structures,
but such information would argue against some versions of flat
syllable theory (e.g., Clements &amp; Keyser, 1983).  Another approach is
to test whether proposed constituent structures like the head or rime
constitute a natural domain for phonotactic constraints.  If there are
many constraints against combining certain vowels with certain codas
(such as the aforementioned illegal combination */ær/) but few if
any against combining vowels with onsets, then that suggests that the
vowel and coda form a structure, the rime.  We investigate this matter
in Study 2.
</p>

<p>The idea of considering phonotactic constraints as evidence for
syllable structure is not new.  Fudge (1969) argued for an onset-rime
structure, claiming that most or all phonotactic constraints in
English involve the vowel and coda.  But Clements and Keyser (1983,
p. 20) favored the flat syllable, stating that ``cooccurrence
restrictions holding between the nucleus [i.e., vowel] and preceding
elements of the syllable appear to be just as common as cooccurrence
restrictions holding between the nucleus and following elements.''
Fudge (1987) responded with extensive tables that showed that
vowel-coda pairs in English have many more gaps than do onset-vowel
pairs.  Part of the reason that the matter remains unsettled is
statistical.  The problem is twofold, involving both false zeroes and
false positives.  Some phonemes are fairly uncommon in English, and
the number of morphemes is finite, so some possible combinations may
fail to exist just because they do not have a reasonable chance to
occur.  A count of zero co-occurrences does not mean there is a
principled constraint against a sequence.  On the other hand, finding
a few co-occurrences does not mean that the phonemes combine freely.
Some phonemes may be so common that one would expect them to appear
together dozens or hundreds of times.  Previous researchers were by no
means naïve on these points: Clements and Keyser admitted that
their claim that voiced fricatives do not appear before /U/ may be
accidental, and they counted /vu/ as a circumscribed sequence even
though they knew about the words <em>voodoo</em> and
<em>rendezvous</em>.  But statistical tests have rarely been applied.
A notable exception is Randolph (1989), who used the likelihood ratio
statistic to test the significance of collocational constraints within
the syllable, all of which he rejected.  But the statistics he
reported were so remarkably low that one suspects that scaling factors
threw them off by several orders of magnitude.
</p>

<p>In this study, we explored co-occurrence patterns by examining a
reasonably comprehensive list of uninflected English CVC words.  We
readily admit that a study of CVC words will not answer all questions
about syllable structure.  Some of the patterns we uncover may reflect
properties of word edges rather than syllable edges; indeed, some
phonologists declare that some or all word-final consonants should not
even be considered part of a syllable (Kenstowicz, 1994, p. 260-261).
Some patterns may have more to do with whether a consonant is
prevocalic or postvocalic, or whether it precedes or follows sentence
stress, than with whether it is in the onset or coda of a syllable.
Despite these warnings, we believe that CVC words are an ideal place
to begin study.  The word list is very homogeneous: All single-coda
consonants are paired with a single onset consonant, and there are no
confounding factors such as extra phonemes or difference in stress or
morphemic composition.  Nor is there any doubt as to
which syllable a consonant belongs to, which is a matter of
no small controversy for English intervocalic consonants (Lass, 1984,
p. 262-268).  Our use of CVC words should not only make the statistical
analyses more straightforward and interpretable, but should
also facilitate follow-up studies.  If in the future different patterns
are found in other carefully constructed databases, the homogeneous
nature of our database should help researchers formulate hypotheses as
to what factors in the word lists account for those differences.
</p>

<h2>Study 1</h2>

<p>In Study 1, we ask whether there are differences in the frequency of
occurrence of the different consonants depending on whether they are
in the onset or the coda. 
</p>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p>We analyzed the 2,001 monomorphemic CVC words found in the unabridged
Random House Dictionary (Flexner, 1987).  We were fervid in our zeal
to eradicate polymorphemic words: A word was rejected if any part of
it is used in the same sense in some other word, so that even words
like <em>this</em> and <em>then</em> were omitted on the grounds that
<em>th</em> may be a demonstrative morpheme.  We omitted all words which
the dictionary gave any reason to believe were not in current general
use throughout America.  Thus we omitted words with foreign phonemes
or accented letters, foreign measures, and place and ethnic names that
were not obviously Anglicized.  We did include given names such as
<em>Dave</em>.
</p>

<p>We used the first pronunciation listed in the dictionary.  The
dictionary phonemes were transcribed on a unit-by-unit basis, except
that /R/, which is treated as the sequence <em>
ûr</em> by Random House (Flexner, 1987), was here treated as a vowel.
As a result, words like <em>bird</em> were included in our list of CVCs.
We did this because /R/ is a phonetically unitary
sound and we wished to avoid any bias from prejudging its underlying
properties. For the other vowels before /r/, which are variously
treated in different accents, we followed the usage of the Dictionary
in recognizing diphthongs before /r/, as well as the vowels /i/
<em>beer</em>, /U/ <em>boor</em>, /E/
<em>(bear)</em>, /O/ <em>(bore)</em>, and /A/
<em>(bar)</em>.  Tables 1 and 2 list the
phonemes recognized in this study, and the phonetic classes to which
they belong.  Note that we treated diphthongs and affricates as units.
</p>

<p>The Random House scheme distinguishes /w/ as in <em>wine</em> from
/W/ as in <em>whine</em>.  It also draws a distinction
between the vowels /Q/ <em>cot</em>, /O/
<em>caught</em>, and /A/ <em>khat, spa</em>.  Although these are
more distinctions than are commonly made in America, we observe
the full set of contrasts because they are dialectically neutral: All
those vowel distinctions are made in parts of New England and
throughout England.  By the same token, we count /O/ as a mid
round vowel even though for most Americans it is low and perhaps even
unrounded.

<p>Table 2 lists the number of times each consonant occurs in the word
list.  Only word types were considered, unweighted by their frequency.
A word type may contain two occurrences of consonants: Thus
<em>bib</em> contributes 2 toward the count of /b/.  To determine
whether the frequencies are affected by syllable position, we
performed for each consonant type separate two-cell goodness-of-fit
tests with Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup>, computing the expected
frequencies under the null hypothesis that consonants would be evenly
distributed between onset and coda.  Because all words had exactly one
onset and one coda consonant, this means that each consonant should
occur half the time in an onset, and half the time in a coda.  To
correct for the fact that the size of the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic
depends in part on the total number of times each consonant occurs, we
also computed the φ coefficient of association for the contingency
tables.  This statistic includes the total number of consonant tokens
as a divisor, and so scales from 0 to 1.  In order to determine
whether there is an overall association between consonant type and
syllable slot across the consonantal system as a whole, we also
computed the χ<sup>2</sup> statistic across all 25 consonant
types.  Finally, we performed a χ<sup>2</sup> decomposition by
phonetic feature class to help understand effects intermediate between
those of the entire table and of individual phonemes.  Here we used
<var>G<sup>2</sup></var>, the likelihood-ratio version of
χ<sup>2</sup>, because it is additive across decompositions.  To
guard against the danger of finding significant results simply because
we made huge numbers of comparisons, we restricted ourselves
throughout this study to only making comparisons between feature sets
that are immediate children of the same node in the trees presented in
Figures 3 and 4. In Study 1, we only looked at the place of
articulation, contrasting two classes of phonemes only when they were
immediate children of the same node in the topmost tree of Figure 3.
For example, anterior coronal consonants as a group were only compared
against nonanterior coronal consonants, but not against labial
consonants.

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Table 3 shows how often each consonant occurs in onset
and coda.  The table is arranged by the strength of association
between consonant type and syllable position (φ).  As one can
see by the number of starred χ<sup>2</sup> statistics, most of the
consonants appear in either the onset or the coda more often than one
would expect.  A χ<sup>2</sup> test for the consonantal system as a whole
gives a significant result (χ<sup>2</sup>(24) = 496.52,
<var>p</var> &lt; .05).  The strength of the association, as
measured by Cramér's coefficient, is .35.

</p>
<p class="caption">*<var>p</var> &lt; .05, 1 df.
</p>

<p>In the <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> decomposition, the total <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> was 601.26.
This value is somewhat unreliable because we had to adjust some zero
cell frequencies, which are undefined for <var>G<sup>2</sup></var>.  Our first step,
therefore, was to partition off any consonants that had structural
zeroes, including the glides /j/ and /w/, which cannot occur in codas
because we define them to be parts of diphthongs (the vowel slot), and
/Z/ and /D/, which arguably occur in the onset in
only special circumstances (loan words and function words,
respectively).  Effects among those consonants, or between them as a
group and the other consonants as a group, were each significant, and
accounted for two thirds of the deviation (<var>G<sup>2</sup></var> of 408.83).
But when we decomposed the remaining <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> by place of
articulation according to the scheme of Figure 3, we
found several other significant deviations having nothing to do with
structural zeroes; these are summarized in Table 4.
The table shows, for example, that coronal consonants prefer the coda
significantly more than noncoronals.  Among coronals, anterior
consonants have a more marked preference for the coda than do
nonanterior coronals.  In contrast to Table 3, this table
shows the direction of the skew within the contrast, not the absolute
direction of the preference.  Thus /d/ is listed as favoring the onset
more than other anterior coronals, even though in absolute numbers
(i.e., when compared to <em>all</em> other consonants) it is found in
the coda somewhat more than in the onset.

Omits consonants largely restricted to either onset
(/h, j, w, W/) or coda (/N, D, Z/).  First column
shows the phonetic category within which a significant skew between

differentiated by whether they appear more often in onset than do
other members of the same category.  The nonanterior consonants
/dZ, S, r, tS}/ did not vary significantly among

</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Our results show that there is an association between consonant type
and syllable position. In the phonemic analysis used by our source
dictionary, glides (/h/, /j/, /w/, /W/) can only occur in
the onset and /N/ can only occur in the coda.  This much is
common knowledge.  What is not commonly recognized is the skew that is
present for several other consonants as well.  In particular, /z/,
/T/, /n/, /t/, /l/ and /k/ show a significant preference for
the coda, and /b/, /dZ/, /S/, and /r/ show a preference for the
onset.  The fact that consonants as a group prefer particular syllable
slots is strong enough to be significant even if one factors out the
consonants for which there is an absolute, inviolable restriction as
to which slot they can go in.  About half of the <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> among the
remaining consonants can be accounted for by significant differences
between contrasting places of articulation, with the strongest effect
being the contrast between anterior and nonanterior coronal
consonants.
</p>

<p>Because the words in our study are all monomorphemic, the prevalence
of /z/, /T/, /n/, and /t/ in codas cannot be explained by
their use as inflectional or derivational endings.  The fact that
coronals, especially anterior coronals, appear disproportionately
often in codas echoes absolute constraints found in other languages.
When languages restrict codas or word endings to consonants of a
particular place of articulation, anterior coronals are the least
likely to be excluded.  The core, native vocabulary of Spanish, for
example, has many words ending in the anterior coronals /D/,
/T/, /s/, /l/, /n/, and /r/, but almost no words ending in
other consonants, even though such consonants are frequent at the
beginning of words.
</p>


<h2>Study 2</h2>

<p>As we pointed out earlier, one test of structural constituency is
whether the items within a proposed constituent are more strongly
associated with each other than they are with items outside of the
structure.  Put another way, items within a constituent should vary
less freely with respect to each other than they do with respect to
other items.  Study 2 was designed to determine whether the vowel and
the coda are more strongly associated with each other than are the
vowel and the onset.  Such a finding would suggest that the vowel and
the coda form a constituent, the rime.  In addition, the existence of
a rime constituent would allow us to treat the distributional patterns
seen in Study 1 as properties of that constituent.  That approach
would simplify our account by obviating the need to hypothesize that
the onset or the coda, or both, are distinguished constituents in
their own right.
</p>

<h3>Method</h3>

<p>The most straightforward way of investigating association patterns
between the three syllable slots would be to consider the data as a
three-variable contingency table, with the levels of each variable
being the different phoneme types.  A first logical step would be to
use log-linear models to test whether the phonemes in each slot are
associated at all with the phonemes in the other slots.
Unfortunately, a three-dimensional contingency table for 24 onset
consonant types × 15 vowel types × 21 coda consonant
types would require 7,560 cells to be populated by 2,001 observations.
That would leave an undesirable number of empty cells, to say the
least.  Performing three-variable contingency table analyses on these
data requires a collapsing into broader categories.  There is,
however, no obvious optimal way to group consonants or vowels into a
small number of classes.  We decided to classify the consonants in
three different ways (by place, manner, and voice; see
Table 2 and Figure 3) and the
vowels in three different ways (by height, backness, and tenseness;
see Table 1 and Figure 4), choosing
categories a priori according to our informal judgments as to what
categories tend to play the biggest role in phonological processes.
For CVC words, this results in 27 different comparisons, for which we
compensate by changing the critical significance level <var>p</var>
from .05 to .001.
</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 4.
Hierarchical organization of
the three classes of vowel features.  This study compares the
distribution of two vowel feature classes only when they are immediate
children of the same node.  Table 1 lists the features
of each of the vowel phonemes.
</p>

<p>When looking at the three-way interactions, we first asked which
associations are significant at the <var>p</var> &lt; .001 level, by looking
at the standard hierarchical log-linear models.  That is, we first
tested for complete independence of all three slots; at the next higher
level, we tested for each slot the hypothesis that it is independent
of the other two slots; at the next level, we tested for each pair of
slots the hypothesis that they are conditionally independent given the
value of the third slot; and finally, we tested for homogeneous
association.  When more than one model adequately fit
the data (that is, the <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> was lower than the significance
level for .001), we selected the model at the lowest level, unless a
higher-level (i.e., more complicated) model provided a significantly better
fit (i.e., the difference in <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> exceeded the .001 significance level
at the differential degrees of freedom).
</p>

<p>Of course, the mere fact of association does not say anything about
the degree of association.  One way to assess the strength of
association is to look at the percentage of total
<var>G<sup>2</sup></var> that a pair association can account for by
itself.  For each pair of slots, we computed the difference between
the <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> that obtains under a model that assumes
that all three pairs of slots are independent, and one that assumes
only that the other two pairs of slots are independent.  Because we
are comparing the triplets along many different features, each of
which has different patterns of variation, we standardized this
difference as a percentage of total <var>G<sup>2</sup></var>.  Of
primary interest are the percentages for onset-vowel and vowel-coda
pairs.  We computed the ratio of the vowel-coda percentage to the
onset-vowel percentage and averaged that across all the feature
systems for which statistically significant pairwise associations were
found.
</p>

<p>It could be that any high association that turned up in in vowel-coda
pairs is due to the absolute co-occurrence restrictions that are
already well known (e.g., the ban against /ær/).  In order to
confirm that nonabsolute restrictions point in the same direction, we
ran the above tests again, this time omitting all words that end in
/r/ or /N/.  These are the two sounds for which all phonologists
agree that there are absolute co-occurrence restrictions for preceding
vowels, in that tense and lax vowels do not contrast in that
environment.  If the pattern of associations still holds when those
170 words are excluded, then our results cannot be explained by those
absolute co-occurrence restrictions.
</p>

<p>Although the foregoing is sufficient to test our hypothesis that
vowel-coda association is much more important than onset-vowel
association, we also want to describe where the interactions lie.  For
example, if we were to find that vowel tenseness interacts with coda
voicing, it would be useful to know whether it is the tense or lax
vowels that are associated with voiced codas.  When one of the
syllable slots varies independently of the other two, this question
can be pursued with some rigor by ignoring that slot and doing a
<var>G<sup>2</sup></var> decomposition on the remaining two-way table.  When doing
so, we applied Bonferroni corrections for 9 comparisons (3 ways of
collapsing each of the two slots by feature) so as to maintain a
familywise significance level of .05.  When none of the slots was
independent, we proceeded less rigorously.  With the understanding
that we may be missing some indirect interactions, we decomposed
two-way tables for each of the associated pairs of slots, so as to get
a feel for each of the pairwise interactions.  We then informally
compared that to the three-way table, noting any obvious interactions.
This part of the analysis is exploratory, intended to provide
hypotheses that later can be tested more rigorously over a larger body
of data.
</p>

<p>Finally, we performed some two-dimensional phoneme-level analyses over
each pair of slots taken independently.  Although this introduces the
danger of misinterpreting indirect associations, it is useful to look
at a less abstract level of analysis (phonemes rather than features)
to avoid losing sight of the broader picture.  To take a theoretical
example, results that generalize over labiodentals in general may
obscure the fact that English has only two labiodental consonant
types, /f/ and /v/, and that indeed they may even behave differently.
So for each pair of slots, we performed a goodness-of-fit χ<sup>2</sup>
on each pair of phonemes.  For example, for the onset-vowel pair
/lu/, we compared the number of times those two sounds occurred
together (15) with the marginal totals for onset /l/ (135) and vowel
/u/ (117).  There being 2,001 words, one would expect them to occur
together 7.89 times.  Whenever the expected frequency was 5 or higher,
we tested whether the difference was significant, using Pearson's
χ<sup>2</sup> to compute a 2 × 2 goodness-of-fit statistic.  We
report which pairs occur significantly more or less often than
expected by chance, and how the number of significant pairs compares
to the count we would expect to see by chance at our significance
level (<var>p</var> &lt; .05).  We also ask whether there is a
significant association between each pair of slots, computed over all
phonemes that appear in those slots.  The usual approach would be to
perform a χ<sup>2</sup> test over a large table of which one dimension
would be, for example, all possible vowel phonemes, and the other
dimension all possible coda consonants.  Unfortunately, the tables for
any of the three pairs of slots would be too sparse for one to put
much faith in a standard χ<sup>2</sup> test: Vowel-coda pairs have 44%
of their cells with expectation lower than 5, many of which are even
lower than 1.  However, one can overcome these limitations by
calculating exact probabilities using a multilevel extension of
Fisher's exact test, determining the distribution by random sampling
of many permutations of the tables.  We did so over 50,000 samples,
and report the Fisher statistic and the Monte Carlo estimate of the
<var>p</var> value.  In each case, we looked for probabilities of .05
or less.  We also calculated Cramér's association statistic for
these tables.
</p>

<p>We also ran all of the above tests on a subset of the dictionary that
only contained words having lax vowels.  Comparing those two sets of
results can help to show which vowel features are responsible for what
association.  The lax vowel subset is also of interest because
virtually all linguists agree that a word-final consonant after a
short, stressed vowel is part of the syllable, rather than
extrasyllabic.
</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Table 5 shows the results of the log-linear analysis of
the three syllable slots, one analysis for each of three ways of
collapsing each of the three slots. The models presented in the table
can be read as saying that a significant association is found between
two slots when they are enclosed within the same set of square
brackets.  In all cases, the hypothesis of three-way association is
rejected.  Because of the low <var>p</var> threshold used for the
individual tests, the finding of an association in any one comparison
is sufficient for concluding the association in CVC words as a whole
at <var>p</var> &lt; .05.  Thus the results as a whole are [OC][VC],
i.e., there are associations between onset and coda and between vowel
and coda, but there is insufficient evidence for assuming any direct
association between onset and vowel.  The patterns are the same
whether we look at the entire set of words or whether we omit those
that end in /r/ or /N/.  On the other hand, as the rows labeled
<em>Lax</em> show, the results change in particular cases if all the
words with tense vowels and diphthongs are omitted.  But even then,
the overall pattern is [OC][VC].

Table shows which log-linear models are significant at
<var>p</var> &lt; .001 when the phonemes in the three syllable slots
are collapsed by the indicated features.  [O][V][C] means that no
associations are accepted; [O][VC] means that vowel and coda are
associated, but onset is independent; [OC][V] means that the onset and
coda are associated, but the vowel is independent; [OC][VC] means that
the coda is associated with both onset and vowel, but that the latter
two are conditionally independent.  Rows labeled <em>Lax</em> tell how
the preceding row changes if only words with lax vowels are included.
</p>

<p>When we looked at the strength of the associations, we found that the
percentage of <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> explained by vowel-coda associations was
always higher than that explained by onset-vowel associations: The
ratio of the first over the second averaged 22.7 (range 1.3 to 104.8)
over the 21 feature comparisons for which the null hypothesis of no
pairwise association had to be rejected.  When we omitted from
consideration all words that end in /r/ or /N/, the average ratio
of vowel-coda strength over onset-vowel was almost the same, 25.2
(range 1.6 to 119.4).  The average ratio was 12.9 (range 1.9 to 54.4)
when only words with lax vowels were considered.
</p>

<p>Having verified our hypothesis that the vowel associates with the coda
much more strongly than with the onset, we turn now to the more
exploratory issues.  One question concerns the direction of the
associations in each comparison.  Such directionality is easier to
visualize in two dimensions than in three.  Fortunately, because most
comparisons show an interaction of only one pair of slots, we can in
most cases collapse the tables down to a comparison between vowel and
coda on the one hand, and onset and coda on the other.  Whenever the
log-linear analysis (Table 5) shows that a pairwise
association between two syllable slots is significant when collapsing
along a particular pair of features, we did a two-way <var>G<sup>2</sup></var>
analysis over those variables, and report the significant subtables
obtained by a <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> decomposition.
For example, Table 5 shows that onset and coda are
associated when the phonemes in both slots are collapsed by place of
articulation. Table 6 shows the subtables 
that are significant for either the entire word set or for the words
with lax vowels, when a <var>G<sup>2</sup></var> decomposition is performed for
onset × coda, collapsing both sets of phonemes by place.
Table 7 gives analogous information for vowel-coda
associations.

</p>

<p>Caution is needed when collapsing consonants by place, because there
are both onset-coda and vowel-coda effects.  However, informal
inspection of the data suggests that the interactions are not
complicated.  The associations between vowel height and coda place do
not conflict with those between onset place and coda place, and indeed
the patterns of association shown in Table 7 hold regardless
of the place of the onset consonant.  On the other hand, associations
between onset place and coda place win out over the associations
between vowel tenseness and coda place.  When the onset is labial, lax
vowels lose their antipathy for coronals, with the dispreference for
labial codas showing up much more strongly.  And when the onset is
postcoronal, lax vowels reverse their normal pattern, preferring
labial codas to velar ones.
</p>

<p>Finally, we report the results of our phoneme-level analyses over each

occur significantly more or less often than expected, based on the
frequencies of the individual phonemes and the assumption of no
association.  The percentage in the last column tells what percent of
the testable pairs (i.e., those with expected frequencies of 5 or
higher) the given list constitutes.  That figure can be compared to
the approximate figure of 5% that would be expected by chance at a
significance level of .05 even if there is no association between
slots.

</p>

<p>Finally, we looked at each pair of slots as a whole, and asked
whether, for example, vowels and codas as a set are significantly
associated at the phoneme level.  The onset-vowel association was not
significant (Fisher statistic 366.1, with a Monte Carlo estimate of
the <var>p</var> value of .13), but the vowel-coda association was
easily significant (Fisher statistic 855.9, with an estimated
<var>p</var> &lt; .0001).  The onset-coda association was also
significant (Fisher 521.9, <var>p</var> = .0067).  Scaling by table
size to find the associated Cramér association statistic,
onset-vowel pairings and onset-coda pairings each have a value .11,
but the vowel-coda statistic is .18.  The comparable figures for the
lax-voweled subset is .16 for onset-vowel pairs, .25 for vowel-coda
pairs, and .14 for onset-coda pairs.
</p>


<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>The results of Study 2 demonstrate that there is a stronger connection
between vowel and coda than between vowel and onset.  Indeed, none of
our tests showed significance for onset-vowel phoneme-level
association.  In contrast, every approach we took to estimating the
association between vowel and coda proved significant.  Similar
results obtain when we compare various indices of the strength of the
two associations, showing that the effect is real.  It is also
encouraging that the same results hold if we omit words with final /r/
and /N/, the major source of absolute co-occurrence restrictions,
and that the basic relationships remain the same if we look only at
words with lax vowels.  Assuming that co-occurrence restrictions are
functions of local structure, these results strongly suggest that
vowel and coda form a constituent, the rime.
</p>

<p>In addition, the more exploratory phase of our investigation revealed
several interesting co-occurrence patterns worthy of being
investigated in future studies with larger word sets.  Among
onset-vowel phoneme pairs, for example, the fact that /ki/ is less
frequent than expected but /si/ is more frequent than expected may
prove to be a real case of onset-vowel association.  This statistical
pattern has been noted for other languages (Maddieson &amp; Precoda,
1992), and in general the replacement of velars by coronals before
front vowels (palatalization) is absolute in many languages, including
Old French, a major source of English vocabulary.  Such meaningful
patterning cautions us against concluding there is no association at
all between onset and vowel, even though that association may not be
significant at our critical level, and even though it is manifestly
much weaker than the vowel-coda association.
</p>

<p>Among onset-coda pairings, all patterns point to favoring of
discords.  This conclusion is very strong with respect to place of
articulation.  In particular, coronal onsets prefer noncoronal codas,
and vice versa.  We also found clear evidence for discord on the basis
of manner of articulation.  The list of statistically significant onset-coda
phoneme pairs almost entirely shows discord in place and especially
manner.  Of the pairs that are more frequent than expected, only one
of them (/tS-k/) fails to match obstruents with sonorants, and it
at least has a place contrast.  Of the pairs that are less frequent
than expected, all are either two sonorants (/l-l, r-l, r-r, h-n,
r-n/) or two obstruents (/p-d, b-p, f-k/), and some of these lack
place contrasts as well. (For the last pair, reasons of tabu probably
also contribute to its rarity.)  That the manner contrasts do not
turn up when we look only at words with lax vowels suggests that there
may really be a three-way interaction here: Perhaps the constraint is
against having both consonants be sonorant when the vowel is tense, or
long, because that would make the syllable too sonorous overall.  As
for the discord in consonant place, similar constraints have been
noted in more complex English syllables (e.g., */spip/ is impossible),
and constraints against identical onset and coda consonants occur in
several other languages (Davis, 1985, pp. 23-30).  But only through
the kind of statistical analysis carried out here can one determine
that tendencies toward onset-coda dissimilarity, although violable,
nevertheless show up in English CVC words. Very similar results were
obtained by Berkley (1994) through statistical methods.
</p>

<p>Vowel-coda pairs show many interesting effects, as itemized in
Table 7.  We can quickly pass over the sparse rightmost
three columns.  The association effects listed there, while real, may
simply reflect a few local effects such as the lack of short central
vowels before /r/, and an association of the round vowel /Q/ with
the labial stops.  In contrast, large effects show up repeatedly in
the first two columns.  However, many of those effects may reflect the
fact that the phonetic features within a given slot do not co-occur in
balanced numbers.  For example, the voicing and manner of articulation
of a coda consonant are directly associated with its coronality, and
most low vowels are lax.  Taking such factors into account, the
tantalizing associations between tenseness and either voicing or
manner, and between low vowels and voice or place, may turn out to
be indirect.  The most reliable associations in the table, from a
causal point of view, may be those between low vowels and less
sonorous codas on the one hand, and between tense vowels and coronal
codas on the other.  This latter finding agrees with the conclusions
of Berg (1994), who performed a statistical study of VC sequences in
standard British English.  Both our study and Berg's show that vowels
that are phonetically longer (tense vowels, including diphthongs)
prefer to be associated with coda consonants that are phonetically
shorter (coronals: Crystal &amp; House, 1988).  The tendency for
phonetically longer vowels to pair with phonetically shorter
consonants may reflect a drive toward isochrony, in Berg's
terminology.  In informal terms, if one has to add a consonant to an
already long rime, it is best that that additional consonant be as
short as possible.  This is often seen on a grosser scale in other
languages, where long vowels must be followed in the same syllable by
fewer consonants, or indeed none at all.
</p>


<h2>General Discussion</h2>

<p>Our statistical study of English monomorphemic CVC words sheds light
on the substructure of the syllable.  If we apply the oft stated
criterion that co-occurrence constraints can be taken as evidence of
structure, and broaden the search criteria so that we accept
quantitative tendencies in addition to absolute restrictions, we find
that co-occurrence constraints between vowel and coda are significant.
That is, we have adduced further evidence for a rime structure.  The
fact that consonants have a different distribution in the coda than in
the onset, quite apart from any association with the vowel (Study 1)
can also be referred to the same structure: Consonants have a
different distribution within the rime than outside it.
</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, however, that this interpretation is not
definitive.  It is conceivable that the vowel only associates with the
last consonant of the word, not the last consonant of all syllables,
or to the contrary that the vowel associates with any immediately
following consonant, whether or not it belongs to the same syllable as
the vowel.  Studies with different word lists will be needed to tease
apart these possibilities, although some research already tends to
corroborate the idea that the associations are syllable-based.  Berg
(1994), for example, found almost exactly the same type of VC
associations as we did, and his database included polysyllabic words.
Randolph (1989) also used polysyllabic words, and although one must
keep in mind his report that associations were not significant, it is
striking that the strength of the associations he reports between
vowels and consonants are two to three times larger for coda
consonants than for onset consonants.
</p>

<p>The other main caveat is that the idea of hierarchical structure in
linguistics is a vaguely defined concept that can easily be
overworked.  We believe that a connectionist approach to language
leads to a consistent and flexible view of structure.  If all
components of a syllable are associated by connections of varying
weights, then a structure can be seen as a reification of those
associations.  In this sense it is meaningful to speak of an element
as simultaneously being a member of many structures, which vary in
strength.  Although such views have been rejected by a number of
linguists (e.g., Davis, 1985, p. 76), Vennemann (1988a, 1988b)
advocates precisely the sort of syllable structure that Davis
rejected: A syllable has a body and also a rime, and even a
discontiguous shell (onset-coda structure), and different patterns of
association may exist within any of these structures (see also
Derwing, Dow, &amp; Nearey, 1988).  That vowel-coda patterns have
significant phonotactic associations justifies talking about a rime
structure.  So does the bulk of other linguistic and experimental
evidence.  But we have also uncovered significant onset-coda
associations, which may justify talking about shells.
</p>

<p>The implications of this study to lexical processing are also obvious,
though not unequivocal.  If our results generalize to the vocabulary
as a whole, then from the standpoint of temporal processing, the first
two thirds of the syllable (onset and vowel) are largely
unpredictable, that is, informative and distinctive, and the last
third (the coda) is largely predictable, that is, redundant.  Such
asymmetries dovetail with experimental evidence showing that English
language processing appears to be optimized for recognizing words from
their beginnings (e.g., Cutler, 1982, p. 19), and for producing words
that have distinctive beginnings (Sevald &amp; Dell, 1994).  These
processing asymmetries may, at least in part, be learned adaptations
to preexisting patterns in the vocabulary, patterns that may have
their origin in physical facts of articulation and acoustics.  Of
course the opposite conclusion is also supported by these statistics:
that the vocabulary itself is shaped because speakers tend to reject
neologisms and sound changes that conflict with the most natural
patterns of temporal processing.  The data raise interesting issues
that are not obvious when one looks at English phonotactics only from
the standpoint of absolute rules and inviolable co-occurrence
restrictions.
</p>

<p>Finally, we believe that our results satisfy our goal of demonstrating
that quantitative methods can pick up patterns that are not unfamiliar
to linguists who advocate strictly categorical approaches to language.
We have shown that English codas and onsets have different consonant
inventories; that the selection of coda consonants depends on vowels
more than the selection of onsets does; that bodies show
palatalization, shells show constraints against identity, and rimes
show isochrony.  These patterns are very common cross-linguistically.
In fact, the results suggest that languages may be more similar to
each other at a statistical level than they are at a categorical
level.  This has important implications for the search for linguistic
universals.
</p>

<p>But one may wonder whether language users are sensitive to the
patterns uncovered here.  On one view, the partial constraints that we
have documented are the detritus of historical inviolable rules.  For
instance, the statistical tendency toward rime isochrony could have
resulted from rules that applied without exception at some point in
the history of some of the source languages of English but that no
longer apply.  On this view, present-day users of English may not
judge newly coined words that follow the statistical patterns as
sounding more natural than words that do not.  On the other hand,
language users may have developed a sensitivity to the distributional
characteristics of English phonemes regardless of their historical
causes.  Work reviewed by Kelly (1992) suggests that adults and even
children show a remarkable sensitivity to subtle patterns in the
language.  Research that is presently being pursued (Treiman, Kessler,
Knewasser, Tincoff, &amp; Bowman, 1996) shows that speakers are indeed
sensitive to the frequencies of rimes.  For example, they rate
nonsense words with more frequent rimes as better than those with less
frequent rimes.  In those experiments, stimuli were selected so as to
cancel out the effects of the frequency of the individual vowel and
coda, so that observed results were necessarily due to the frequency
of the rime as a whole.  Such findings suggest that, whatever the
origins of the distributional patterns in present-day English,
language users pick up these patterns.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have shown that statistical techniques reveal phonotactic patterns
in English that are very similar to the inviolable phonotactic
restrictions that have been noted in other languages.  In particular,
the fact that the association between vowel and coda is so much
greater than that between vowel and onset buttresses analyses that
posit rimes as syllable constituents.  Those unequal associations mean
greater distinctiveness at the beginning of the syllable, which may be
connected to findings that people produce and recognize words more
efficiently the more distinctive the beginnings of those words are.
</p>

<p>Together with other recent studies that have analyzed large lexical
databases in order to elucidate the patterns in languages (e.g.,
Berkley, 1994; Frauenfelder, Baayen, Heelwig, &amp; Schreuder, 1993;
Krupa, 1982; Treiman, Mullennix, Bijeljac-Babic, &amp; Richmond-Welty,
1995), the present study represents a departure from traditional
linguistic and psycholinguistic work.  We believe that there is much
to be learned from detailed statistical studies of language and that
the results of such studies will have important implications for the
search for language universals and for our understanding of language
processing.
